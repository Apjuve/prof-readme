## Description

This application is designed to make writing readme files quick and easy. The application uses Node.js and the Inquirer npm to generate a professional and consistently formatted readme file from the command line. Once installed, the user only needs to answer the questions to generate a readme.md file for use in the project repository.
 
## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* NPM "Inquirer"

## Functionality

This application uses Node.js and the 'Inquirer' npm to create a readme file for use in GitHub repositories. Once the application is installed, the user is presented with a series of prompts about their current project. The user can skip questions by pressing "Enter," which will leave that section blank. The user can also alter the questions function in the index.js file to add or remove questions as needed.

## Demo


## Example README.md
#### The example readme was generated using the README Generator application I built. The readme file represented in these screentshots is located in the "Markdown" folder.

## Challenges

The main challenge of this project was the license section. Deciding which licenses to make available was the first challenge. Once I had created a list of the most common licenses, it was a matter of generating links to the documentation for each license. The other challenge was creating the badges for the licenses. I used Shields.io to create the badges.

## Usage
* Use this app to create a professional and complete readme.md file from the command line.
* Use to understand Node.js and npm libraries.

## Installation
* Install Node.js
* Enter 'npm init' in command line
* Enter 'npm i' in the command line
* Enter 'node index.js' in the command line

## Future Development
* Increase the number of available licenses.
* Broaden the use case for this app and create something similar that will render an html page.
* Integrate into existing projects.
